ðŸª´ **Welcome to the Rust Redis Clone digital garden** ðŸ¦€

We're embarking on an exciting journey of learning and experimentation, creating our own clone of Redis in Rust. Inspired by the Tokio tutorial that walks through building a simplified Redis server, we're diving deeper into our own implementation to gain a better understanding of Rust's intricacies and the architecture behind Redis. This project is a hands-on opportunity to sharpen our programming skills while exploring the powerful language of Rust.

**Goals**

Our aims for this digital garden are straightforward:

1. Learn more about Rust through practical experience by building a Redis clone.
2. Deepen our understanding of Redis's architecture and key concepts by reconstructing them in Rust.
3. Share our progress, insights, and challenges to help others exploring similar paths.

**Updates**

**Exploring the Garden**

This garden is a space for growth, exploration, and discovery. While we start with a solid foundation, the paths through our notes will shift and expand as our knowledge deepens. Key topics of interest include:

- [[Tokio]]
- [[Mini-Redis]]

Here, youâ€™ll see our thoughts grow, change, and mature as we progress on our Rust Redis journey. Stay tuned for future updates and feel free to reach out with suggestions or your own thoughts on Rust and Redis!
