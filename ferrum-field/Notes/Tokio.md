> [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks needed for writing networking applications. It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices.

## Notes

- [[Tokio tasks are green threads]]
- [[Tokio spawn vs. select!]]
